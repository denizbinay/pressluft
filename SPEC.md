# SPEC Router

This file is a top-level routing entry point for product and behavior specs.

Canonical sources:

- Product vision: `docs/vision-and-purpose.md`
- User workflows: `docs/user-requirements-and-workflows.md`
- Feature-level implementation specs: `docs/features/README.md`
- Full document index: `docs/spec-index.md`

Implementation rule:

- Do not implement from this file directly. Use one governing feature spec under `docs/features/`.
