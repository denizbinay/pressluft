# ARCHITECTURE Router

This file is a top-level routing entry point for technical architecture.

Canonical sources:

- System architecture: `docs/technical-architecture.md`
- Data model authority: `docs/data-model.md`
- Job execution model: `docs/job-execution.md`
- Ansible execution contract: `docs/ansible-execution.md`
- Full document index: `docs/spec-index.md`

Implementation rule:

- Architecture changes must update canonical docs in the same PR.
