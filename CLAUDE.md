# CLAUDE.md

Compatibility shim for Claude-based tooling only.

OpenCode remains canonical for this repository:

- Runtime bootstrap: `opencode.json`
- Primary execution contract: `AGENTS.md`

If used via Claude tooling, mirror the same startup contract:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/spec-index.md`.
3. Read `PLAN.md` and `PROGRESS.md`.
4. Read one governing feature spec in `docs/features/`.
5. Follow `Spec -> Plan -> Act -> Verify`.
