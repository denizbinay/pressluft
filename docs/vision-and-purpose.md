# Vision and Purpose

Pressluft exists to eliminate infrastructure friction from professional WordPress work. Agencies and freelancers should not spend cognitive energy on server tuning, fragile migrations, inconsistent staging environments, or late night recovery after failed updates. The problem is not raw performance. The problem is unreliable workflow.

Pressluft defines and maintains a strict, secure, and reproducible WordPress stack designed for maintainability over magic tweaks. No snowflake servers. No weekly configuration experiments. Just a hardened, predictable runtime with clear upgrade paths and safe defaults. Around that stack we build what actually matters: one click staging, reliable cloning, safe database synchronization, Git based theme and plugin deployment, deterministic backups, and reversible production pushes. Infrastructure becomes boring. Delivery becomes fast.

Our goal is to bring open source WordPress hosting to the same operational level as the dominant managed platforms, but on our own hardware and under our control, without sacrificing comfort, reliability, or developer experience. Pressluft is not another hosting provider. It is infrastructure automation with a contract. A system you can trust, inspect, run yourself, or use as a hosted service.

You focus on your craft. Pressluft handles the rest.
