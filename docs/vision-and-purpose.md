# Vision and Purpose

Pressluft exists to eliminate infrastructure friction from professional WordPress work. Agencies and freelancers should not spend cognitive energy on server tuning, fragile migrations, inconsistent staging environments, or late night recovery after failed updates. The core problem is not raw performance. The core problem is unreliable workflow and fear of breaking production.

Pressluft defines and maintains a strict, secure, and reproducible WordPress runtime built for maintainability over magic tweaks. No snowflake servers. No weekly configuration experiments. Just a hardened, predictable stack with clear upgrade paths and safe defaults. Around this runtime, we focus on what actually matters: one-click site creation, instant staging and cloning, safe pushbacks with drift protection, deterministic backups, and fully reversible production changes.

Our goal is to bring open source WordPress infrastructure and workflow automation to the same operational standard as leading managed platforms — but on your own hardware, under your control, and without sacrificing simplicity or developer comfort. Pressluft is not another hosting provider. It is a WordPress state management system with a contract: predictable, isolated, and reversible at every step.

You focus on delivering value. Pressluft makes change safe.
