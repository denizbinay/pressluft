# Architecture Decision Records

This directory stores durable rationale for architecture and process decisions.

## Rules

- Use sequential filenames: `NNNN-short-title.md`.
- Use `docs/adr/template.md` for new records.
- ADRs should capture context, decision, consequences, and alternatives.
- ADRs are append-only history; do not rewrite prior decisions silently.

## Current ADRs

- `docs/adr/0001-spec-routing-and-contract-authority.md`
