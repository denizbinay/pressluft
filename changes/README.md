# Changes Directory

This directory contains proposal-based change packets for major changes.

## Usage

- Copy `changes/_template/` into `changes/<slug>/`.
- Fill `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` before implementation.
- Link governing specs from `docs/spec-index.md`.

## Status Tracking

- Add active change folders under "Active".
- Move completed folders under "Archived" after canonical docs are updated.

### Active

- `changes/wp-first-runtime/`

- `changes/provider-first-node-acquisition/`

### Archived
